# small shell project

This project is a C program which acts as a Unix shell (similar to Bash). Functionalities include basic built-in commands (ls, cd, and exit), other commands using the exec family of functions, input/output redirection, support for running foreground and background processes, and more.

To run this program, use the following commands:  
`$gcc --std=gnu99 -o smallsh smallsh.c`  
`$./smallsh`  
The first command will compile the program, and the second will run the executable.
